# MODEL-EXPLAINATION
This repertory is reserved to resume the recent techniques of model explanation including ML classical models and Deep Learning models.
 ** ML Classical **
 * LIME: is model-agnostic, so that it can be applied to any model. The technique aims to pertubate the local input data and aproximate the output's model by another easy interpretable model   
 
 **Deep Learning**
 * Saliency maps from network graient.
 * DeConvNet.
 * Guided BackProp.
 * Layer wise Relevance Propagation. 
 * Deep Taylor Decomposition.
